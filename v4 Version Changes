Complete overhaul of the code to make it easier to read and change

New Features:
    Added ability to edit lines on the syncing screen instead of having to 
        back to first screen which makes you loose all your progress
    Added visual aid to see the syncing that has been done in real time
    Added support for album tags
    The help menu now runs by default when clicking onto the 3rd screen
    Fixed Firefox issue where the first line would not be selected by default
    + lots of other fixes which make it harder for you to do something wrong :)
