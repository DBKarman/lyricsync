# Lyricsync
An .lrc file creator/generator.
This lrc generator website/browser application allows you to paste in the lyrics to a song, upload the song and then listen to the song and synchronise the lyrics line by line in order to generate an .lrc file which can be used by music players.
In order to get started, either use the online version at https://dbkarman.github.io/lyricsync/ or simply download all the files in the repository and open up "index.html" in a web browser, preferably a Chromium one such as Google Chrome/Edge.
If you need any help, simply visit https://github.com/DBKarman/lyricsync/discussions or email me at github.dbkarman@gmail.com.
This project is maintained by only me, DBKarman. I will try to update and improve this as frequently as possible to fix buggs and add improvements but there is only so much one man can do.
Any feedback would be much appreciated :)
