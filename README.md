# Lyricsync
An .lrc .file creator, currently a work in progress
This lrc generator website allows you to paste in the lyrics to a song, upload the song and then listen to the song and synchronise it with the lyrics in order to generate an .lrc file
In order to get started, either use the online version at https://dbkarman.github.io/lyricsync/ or simply download all the files in the repository and open up index.html in a web browser
If you need any help, simply visit https://github.com/DBKarman/lyricsync/discussions or email me at github.dbkarman@gmail.com
This project is maintained by only me, DBKarman, I will try to update and improve this as much as possible but there is only so much guy man can do
Any feedback would be much appreciated :)
